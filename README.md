# Iris-Flower-Classification
Iris Dataset Classification

This repository contains an analysis of the Iris dataset, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and classification using different machine learning models. The dataset consists of 150 samples across 4 features (sepal and petal dimensions) and 3 species of iris flowers.

Features
Data cleaning (removal of unnecessary columns)

Exploratory data analysis with histograms and scatter plots

Correlation analysis to understand feature relationships

Model training using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree classifiers

Results
Logistic Regression: 100% accuracy

KNN: 97.78% accuracy

Decision Tree: 95.56% accuracy

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for classification problems.
